There is a huge gap between 1955 and 1970 which means that trees are not planted during that period. \n\n## Size and Diameter of Trees\n\n### The question to answer\n\n-   How the size and diameter of trees differ from each status?\n-   Are landmark trees are tend to be thicker or bigger?\n\n::: callout-important\nSize or Diameter of tree are often defined as **DBH** which is **'Diameter at breast height'**. \n\nTree sizes are measured at the adult's breast height, which usually differs by countries and situations. In many countries, DBH is measured at approximately 1.3 m (4.3 ft) above ground.

But there is no big DBH difference between those other three groups. In addition, we could observe that some of trees maintained by DPW tends to be bigger and thicker than from other two groups(Permitted, Undocumented). \n  \n\n\n::: {.cell .column-margin}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntrees %>%\n  filter(short_status %in% c(\"DPW \",\"Land\",\"Perm\",\"Undo\"), dbh <= 2000 , dbh >0) %>%\n  group_by(status) %>%\n  summarise(average = round(mean(dbh),2),\n            sd = round(sd(dbh),2)) %>%\n  knitr::kable(col.names = c(\"Legal Status\", \"Average DBH (inch)\",\"Standard deviation (inch)\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|Legal Status   | Average DBH (inch)| Standard deviation (inch)|\n|:--------------|------------------:|-------------------------:|\n|DPW Maintained |               9.97|                     12.03|\n|Landmark tree  |              37.13|                     13.96|\n|Permitted Site |              10.11|                     11.01|\n|Undocumented   |              11.63|                     10.54|\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Summary\n\nThere are three main questions I aim to answer from this data analysis. The first one is 'What is the status of the trees and how are distributed?'. We could find that most of the trees are maintained by DPW, permitted sites. The next largest population of trees were undocumented whose legal status was unknown. By second analysis of trees regarding their age and date planted, we could visualize it's an overall trend when they were planted.[@Tom2017]  Lastly, we could check the distribution of the trees' size defined as DBH, and we could find that the size of Landmark trees is significantly larger than other trees. \n\n## Functions\n\n### dplyr\n-   filter()\n-   select()\n-   group_by()\n-   summarise()\n-   rename()\n-   mutate()\n\n### ggplot2\n\n-   geom_bar()\n-   geom_line()\n-   geom_boxplot()\n-   facet_wrap()\n\n\n\n\n\n",
