We could find that most of the trees are maintained by DPW, permitted sites. The next largest population of trees were undocumented whose legal status was unknown. By second analysis of trees regarding their age and date planted, we could visualize it’s an overall trend when they were planted.(Molanphy 2017) Lastly, we could check the distribution of the trees’ size defined as DBH, and we could find that the size of Landmark trees is significantly larger than other trees."
